            <h1><b>Spider-Man // Peter Parker</b></h1>
                <p>Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
                    writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing
                    Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in films,
                    television shows, novels, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan
                    raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in
                    a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial
                    issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry
                    Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor
                    Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets superhuman spider-powers and
                    abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces and ceilings,
                    superhuman strength, speed, and agility, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called
                    "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of
                    his own design that were meant to be used for fighting his enemies and web-swinging across the city.
                    After his personal tragedy of his late Uncle Ben, Peter began using his spider-powers to fight against
                    crime as Spider-Man.</p>
