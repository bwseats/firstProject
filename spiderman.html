            <h1 class="mt-3 text-light"><b>Spider-Man // Peter Parker</b></h1>
            <p class="text-light">Peter Benjamin Parker is a former Midtown School of Science and Technology student who
                gained spider-like abilities, fighting crime across New York City as the superhero Spider-Man. While
                Parker juggled his hero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was approached by Tony Stark
                who recruited Spider-Man to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into a brief conflict with
                his personal hero, Captain America. Parker was given a new suit as well as new Stark technology in
                exchange for his help, allowing him to return home to continue his own hero work.
                While he continued to try and prove himself as a worthy hero in the eyes of Iron Man so he could join
                the Avengers, Parker began investigating the illicit criminal activities of Vulture, who was attempting
                to sell his Chitauri based weapons onto the black market, with only the assistance of his best friend
                Ned Leeds, while also trying to win his academic decathlon finals. Eventually, Parker gained the
                affections of classmate Liz Allan, but learned her father, Adrian Toomes, was Vulture. Spider-Man
                thwarted Vulture's robbery of a Stark Industries cargo plane, to which Stark showed his respect by
                offering Parker an official place with the Avengers. Parker turned this down in order to continue being
                a small-time hero in New York, despite his Aunt May discovering his secret identity.</p>
