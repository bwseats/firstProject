            <h1 class="mt-3"><b>Captain America // Steve Rogers</b></h1>
                <p>Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
                    cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover
                    dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a
                    patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most
                    popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and
                    the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since
                    Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.
                    The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he carries a nearly-indestructible
                    shield that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young
                    artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining
                    the military to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he
                    was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. Although
                    Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly
                    respected figure both with the American public and in the superhero community, which includes becoming
                    the long-time leader of the Avengers.</p>
