            <h1><b>Power Man // Luke Cage</b></h1>
            <p>Lucas "Luke" Cage, born Carl Lucas and also known as Power Man, is a fictional character appearing in
                American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #1 (June
                1972) and was created by Archie Goodwin, George Tuska, Roy Thomas, and John Romita Sr. He is one of
                the earliest black superheroes to be featured as the protagonist and title character of a Marvel comic
                book.
                Created during the height of the blaxploitation genre, Luke Cage had been imprisoned for a crime he did
                not commit and gained the powers of superhuman strength and unbreakable skin after being subjected
                voluntarily to an experimental procedure. Once freed, he becomes a "hero for hire" and has forty-nine
                issues of solo adventures (comic title renamed to Luke Cage, Power Man with issue #17). In issue #50,
                Cage teams up with fellow superhero Iron Fist as part of a crime-fighting duo in the renamed title,
                Power Man and Iron Fist. He later marries the super-powered private investigator Jessica Jones, with
                whom he has a daughter. In 2005, writer Brian Michael Bendis added Luke Cage to the lineup of the New
                Avengers, and he has since appeared in various Avengers titles, becoming leader of a group of reformed
                supervillains called the Thunderbolts, and eventually becoming the Mayor of New York City at the
                conclusion of the 2021â€“2022 crossover event "Devil's Reign", succeeding the Kingpin.</p>
