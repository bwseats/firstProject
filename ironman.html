            <h1><b>Iron Man // Tony Stark</b></h1>
            <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was
                co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists
                Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated
                March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). In 1963, the character founded the
                Avengers superhero team with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.
                A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony
                Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force
                him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his
                life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological
                devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to
                protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly
                reveals himself to be Iron Man.
                Initially, Stan Lee used Iron Man to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American
                technology and industry in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have
                shifted to contemporary matters.
                Iron Man has headlined various comic book series. Throughout most of the character's publication
                history, he has been a founding member of the Avengers.</p>
